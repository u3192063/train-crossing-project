## Context, Constraint and Stakeholder Description

**Context:** Controlling a rail and road crossing. The gates must go down when a train is coming or is on the tracks and also for when there is a vehicle on the tracks. The gates only go up when the train has fully passed and the tracks are clear.

**Constraint:** 
Technical - Use simple on and off signals. Do not raise the gate if the train/vehicle is on the crossing signals on.

Economic - Keep the parts and sensors that are used to a minimum. Use low cost items while bearing safety in mind.

Social - Warnings and sounds must be easy to see and hear. Avoid long delays.

Environmental - Must work in rain, heat, dusty/moist air and with electrical interference.

Legal - Follow local guidelines for the best practices on safety, building codes and regulations.

**Stakeholders:** 
- The primary stakeholders are road users such as drivers/pedestrians, who need clear warnings (lights and sounds) with safety and efficiency in mind to minimise wait times. 
- Railway staff need reliable protection so no vehicle is on the crossing at the same time as the train. 
- Maintenance crews need clear status indicators (water damage or electrical fault) and simple checklists that can be easily followed. 
- Regulators need clear documentation on how the crossing works and how it will behave in different situations.
