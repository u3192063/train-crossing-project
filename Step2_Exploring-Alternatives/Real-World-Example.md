## Real world example:
Ilampiray et al. (2021) built a small, low cost automatic crossing using an
Arduino, two ultrasonic sensors, LEDs, a buzzer and a servo motor for the boom gates. One sensor before the crossing detects the trainâ€™s approach which then triggers the buzzer/
red lights to turn on and the servo drives the gate down. A second sensor after the
crossing confirms the train has passed, then the buzzer turns off and the gate opens.
The authors argue this simple, fully automated setup reduces accidents at unmanned
crossings and worked reliably in their prototype tests.
