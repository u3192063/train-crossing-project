## Brainstormed ideas:
1. If the train on crossing is off, keep the gates down for approx 5-10 secs. If another train approaches then turn on and gates will stay down. This will handle back to back trains. \
2. Only allow the gates to be raised if the vehicle on crossing is not on for more than 3 secs any trigger otherwise will reset the 3 second timer.
