## Refinements

- Bell should mute after a few seconds after the gate comes down so it wonâ€™t be annoying for waiting drivers or pedestrians.
- If the gate starts raising and a hazard is detected the gate should default to down.
- Check if there is a second train inbound and keep the gate down to accommodate it.
- Keep the 3 second all clear check but it should be adjustable depending on the situation.
