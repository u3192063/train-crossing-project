1. Power check:
- If the power is not ok then go to the fail safe

2. Fail safe:
- Drive the gate down.
- Turn the warning light and bell on.
- Then keep rechecking inputs

3. Read inputs:
- TA = Train Approaching
- ToC = Train on Crossing
- VoC = Vehicle on Crossing
- GateDown, GateUp = Limit switches

4. If TA or ToC or VoC is on:
- Gates go down until GateDown is on or a fault occurs.
- Keep the lights and bell on.
- If fault then gates stay down

5. If no hazard:
- Start a short clear buffer for about 3 secs
- If TA, ToC or VoC turns on during the buffer then cancel and go back to read inputs.

6. If the clear buffer finishes with no hazards:
- Gates go back up until GateUp is on or a fault occurs
- When fully up it will turn both lights and bells off
- If fault then go back into gate down

7. Loop continuously from read input.
