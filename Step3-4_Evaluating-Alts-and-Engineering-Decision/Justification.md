## Justification
**Chose the 2nd option with the 3 sec clear check because:**
- Itâ€™s simple, any hazard detected the gate does down, when it's all clear after a short buffer time the gate goes up.
- Its safe because the 3 secs continuous hazard clear check makes sure the gate does not spring back up
- It is reliable, it works with a basic on or off input and small debounce. On any fault gates will default to down with the lights and sound on.
