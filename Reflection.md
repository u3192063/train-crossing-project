##Reflection

I used Copilot for refining the overall logic and polishing the readme. First, I asked it to scan my step by step rules for the level crossing and point out any places where the gates might raise at the wrong time. It suggested adding a short all clear delay before raising, keeping the lights and bell on until the gates are fully up, and treating any motion fault or odd sensor reading as fail safe. I added a three second clear window and clarified the fail safe behaviour, which made the flowchart and tests more consistent. Second, I asked for help on how to make a clear readme as I have never made one before. Copilot kept my structure but tightened the wording and helped with learning how to link folders/files. These two were really helpful but the help with the readme was much needed as I learned a lot from that process for example how to use the # and * symbols.
